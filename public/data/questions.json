    "question": "What are CSS pseudo-elements and how do they differ from pseudo-classes?",
    "answer": "Pseudo-elements (::before, ::first-line) style specific parts of an element or generate content. Pseudo-classes (:hover, :nth-child()) style elements based on state or position. Pseudo-elements create virtual elements, pseudo-classes select existing ones in specific states."

    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'loading' attribute in images?",
    "answer": "The 'loading' attribute controls lazy loading behavior: 'lazy' defers loading until near viewport, 'eager' loads immediately. It improves performance by prioritizing visible content loading, especially for long pages with many images."

    "answer": "Pattern: /^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$/. Matches # followed by 3 or 6 hex digits. For strict CSS colors (no shorthand): /^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{3}){1,2}$/. Add word boundaries if needed: /\\b#[A-Fa-f0-9]{3,6}\\b/"

    "question": "How do you handle database indexing with Prisma?",
    "answer": "Define indexes in your Prisma schema using the @@index attribute on models. For complex indexes or full-text search, you may need to use raw SQL in migrations. Prisma also supports defining unique constraints with @@unique."

    "question": "How does Drizzle ORM handle full-text search?",
    "answer": "Drizzle provides SQL functions that can be used for full-text search, like to_tsvector and to_tsquery in PostgreSQL. You can write raw SQL queries with these functions or create helper functions that abstract the search implementation."
